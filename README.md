## COVID++

### About
COVID++ is a user-friendly and intuitive program that provides meaningful information
and statistics of the COVID pandemic while comparing two efficient sorting algorithms: merge and 
shell sort. 

### Instructions
Run the program from main.cpp. Input a number 1-5 for the desired operation.
Input -1 to quit the program. 

### A Note About IDE Environments and Compiling
For CLion environments, you must edit the run configuration. The working directory
must be the directory "COVID-plus-plus/src" to access the CSV file.

For GCC compiled environments (VSCode), the program should execute properly.

### A Note About the Dataset
Data points after November 2020 were randomly generated to satisfy the 100,000 data point requirement. 
Results generated from data prior to this date, however, are accurate.
